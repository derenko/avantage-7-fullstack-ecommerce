      "The Concepts x Nike Dunk Low SB 'Orange Lobster' continues a collaborative series that originally kicked off in 2008. In crafting the shoe's design, the Boston-based shop looks to the rare orange lobster for inspiration. Varying shades of orange are applied to the nubuck upper, featuring lightly speckled overlays and a tonal Swoosh outlined in white. A woven Nike SB tag embellishes the white mesh tongue, while a bib-themed pattern decorates the interior lining. The sneaker sits atop a traditional cupsole, featuring black sidewalls and a grippy orange rubber outsole.",
